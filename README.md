# apod: Astronomy Picture of the Day

This project displays photos from Nasa.
The app uses NASA’s REST API to fetch today's photo. They provide API to search photos by date or date range. You can check the details of API the following link:

The app is simple. It just fetches a week’s data and shows descriptions only since the photo is a bit large and they don't support the thumbnail of the photo.

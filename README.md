# apod: Astronomy Picture of the Day

This project displays photos from Nasa.
The app uses nasa's REST api to fetch today's photo. They provides api to search photos by date or date range.

App is simple. It just fetch a week data and shows descriptions only since photo is a bit large and they don't support thumbnail of photo.
